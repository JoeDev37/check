# Daily Task Tracker

A simple web application for tracking daily tasks and activities.

### Description

This project allows users to add, remove, and count daily tasks. Each task is represented as a list item in the user interface. Users can incrementally count completed days and see the total count displayed at the center of the page. The task list and count are persisted using local storage, so they will remain even after refreshing the page.
